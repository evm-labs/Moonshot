# Moonshot
In this repo you will find one core contract, Moonshot.sol, that serves as a **template** of how a prospect can:
1. Start a fundraising process to collect a set amount of ETH
2. Define a deadline at which the process will end
3. Distribute tokens or return the funds depending on the outcome of the fundraising process
4. Deposit earnings (future revenue) that the prospect may make
5. Distribute earnings to talent

# Future use - Todos
1. Tests are not complete - need to finish those
2. Can generalise this and either make a core contract similar to Manifold's core contract https://github.com/manifoldxyz/creator-core-solidity
3. Create a new ERC standard
